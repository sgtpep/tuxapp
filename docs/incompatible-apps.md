# Incompatible apps

`tuxapp` requires some significant modifications or workarounds to make these apps working which may be resolved later.

- **Ring** https://ring.cx/: the daemon executable needs to be launched before the graphical one.
- **Seafile** https://www.seafile.com/en/home/: unable to parse the latest version number, no indicator/tray icon apears
- **Steam** http://store.steampowered.com/: the application requires x86 libraries on the x86-64 architecuture.
- **k2pdfopt** http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/: download requires solving a CAPTCHA.
