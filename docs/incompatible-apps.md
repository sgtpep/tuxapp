# Incompatible apps

`tuxapp` requires some significant modifications or workarounds to make these apps working which may be resolved later.

- *Ring* https://ring.cx/: the daemon executable needs to be launched before the graphical one.
- *Steam* http://store.steampowered.com/: the launcher script has some hardcoded absolute paths; the application requires x86 libraries on the x86-64 architecuture.
